      Red-Hot Panthers have all the momentum right now
    </h3>

    <p>The Florida Panthers are red-hot and tantalizingly close to a wild card spot that seemed pretty distant just a month ago. It’s an amazing turnaround for a squad that appeared to be destined for heartbreak again and while the work isn’t done yet, going
      13-3 in their past 16 games (including an ongoing six-game win streak) is a great sign. So why have the Cats woken up? Well, hockey is a team game and as such, there have been many notable contributors. One of the biggest stabilizers has been star
      goalie Roberto Luongo, who has won six of seven starts since returning to the lineup from a lower body injury. Such ailments certainly contributed to Florida’s earlier flailing, as both Luongo and fellow veteran James Reimer have been banged up.
      At one point, the Panthers had to call up youngster Samuel Montembeault to back up third-stringer Harri Sateri – something they weren’t anxious to do, given that Montembeault is playing his first season of pro hockey. Sateri himself deserves credit
      for saving Florida’s season. Though he is back in the minors now, the Finnish netminder put together four straight wins in late January/early February, helping Florida pull out of a tailspin. But a lot of the credit for the recent en fuego play
      has to go to the top line, spearheaded by center Aleksander Barkov. It’s been pretty well established by now that Barkov is one of the most talented two-way players in the game right now, capable of highlight-reel goals and taking on tough defensive
      assignments all at once. He’s been logging a heavy workload during this run of good play (including a season-high 27:27 in an overtime win versus Toronto) and the big pivot has been particularly fruitful of late, notching points in all six of Florida’s
      recent wins. And he’s not alone. Linemate Evgenii Dadonov is proving that you can indeed get a second chance at NHL success with his own great play. Dadonov has four multi-point games in his past five outings and at this rate, he may finish the
      season as a point-per-gamer. That’s pretty good for a veteran who took a five-season KHL holiday since his last North American campaign. With players such as Jonathan Huberdeau and Vince Trocheck also contributing up front, the Cats are in a good
      place right now. Florida’s stable of talent can shock teams with quick-strike stretch passes and the finishers have the deft hands to cash in on those opportunities. Looking at the rest of Florida’s schedule reveals a golden road headed towards
      the playoffs. Already in a wild card slot, the Panthers have 19 games left on the schedule, nine of which are against opponents with nothing to play for but lottery positioning (Edmonton, Ottawa, Montreal, Buffalo, Arizona and the Rangers). Two
      of the final three games are against Boston, a team that, at that point, will likely rest key players as the Bruins prepare for what could be a very nice playoff run themselves. Even better for the Panthers is the fact that the teams they are chasing
      – New Jersey and Columbus – have three fewer games left on the schedule. In fact, one extra win would vault Florida over the Blue Jackets, while two would also put them ahead of the Devils. Carolina, which is also chasing a wild card spot, only
      has 16 games remaining, too. Which is a long way of saying that Florida’s recent surge is having a tremendously negative impact on the Metropolitan Division. I think most of us assumed the Atlantic would be a three-team playoff division this spring,
      but Florida would even things up in the East. Columbus seemed like a pretty easy team to pick for a playoff berth, while New Jersey has been one of the best stories of the year. Now that’s all in flux. While the Jackets and Devils have cooled down
      at the wrong time, Florida is the hottest team in the conference. Can the Panthers keep the good times rolling all the way to the post-season?

      Kobe Bryant's 'Dear Basketball' wins Oscar for Best Animated Short Film
    </h3>
    <p id=Al>
      The former Los Angeles Lakers star won an Oscar in the animated short category for "Dear Basketball,a poem he penned for The Players Tribune in 2015. He'll add it to an already jammed trophy collection that includes five NBA championships with the Lakers,
      two Olympic gold medals, NBA Finals most valuable player awards, a league MVP award and four All-Star game MVP awards. Backstage, Bryant looked lovingly at the statue cradled in his hands and mouthed, "My God." "I feel better than winning championships,"
      he said, a smile never leaving his face. "This is crazy, man, it's crazy." As executive producer, Bryant accepted his golden Oscar statue from "Star Wars" star Mark Hamill on Sunday night. He shared the award with Disney animator Glen Keane. "You
      don't have to sit in a tub of ice," Keane told Bryant backstage. Relive the 10 best plays from Kobe Bryant's storied NBA career! Among those offering their congratulations via Twitter were Hall of Famers Magic Johnson, Bill Russell and Shaquille
      O'Neal, Bryant's former Lakers teammate who admitted, "I'm jealous lol." Since hanging up his basketball shoes, Bryant has delved into business (a new Nike shoe) and various forms of storytelling. The 39-year-old sports superstar believed the nomination
      validated that he could succeed off the court. "As basketball players, we're told to shut up and dribble," Bryant said on stage. "I'm glad we did a little bit more than that." Bryant said he heard dismissive comments like "That's cute" when he told
      people he wanted to become a storyteller in retirement. "The hardest thing when you start over, you have to quiet the ego and begin again. You have to learn the basics of things," he said. He thanked his wife, Vanessa, and his three daughters, naming
      each of them. He spoke a few words of Italian - a language he learned as a child growing up in Italy - and closed by telling them, "You are my inspiration." Backstage, Bryant credited Oprah Winfrey and writer-producer Shonda Rhimes for sharing their
      knowledge of the entertainment business. "When you have mentors like that in your life, everything tends to work itself out," he said.

      Fiorentina captain Astori dies suddenly aged 31
    </h3>

      Serie A postponed all of Sunday’s matches, including the derby between AC Milan and Inter Milan, as Italian and European clubs and dozens of players sent messages of condolence and expressed their disbelief. “Fiorentina is deeply upset to have to announce
      that its captain Davide Astori has passed away, victim of a sudden illness,” said Fiorentina in a statement. “Due to the terrible and delicate situation, and above all for the respect of his family, an appeal is made to everyone’s sensitivity.”
      Defender Astori, in his 10th Serie A season, was found dead in his hotel room in Udine, where Fiorentina had been due to face Udinese at the Dacia Arena later on Sunday. The Fiorentina staff became worried when Astori, who was married with a daughter,
      did not join his team mates for breakfast at around 9.30 a.m. local time, club spokesman Arturo Mastronardi told reporters outside the hotel. Astori, who made 289 top-flight appearances, joined Fiorentina on loan in August 2015 and the club signed
      him outright one year later. He previously spent six seasons at Cagliari and one on loan at AS Roma. He was raised at AC Milan but never played for their senior team. He made 14 appearances for Italy between 2012 and 2017 and was in the squad at
      the Confederations Cup in 2013 where Italy finished third. Udine state prosecutor Antonio Di Nicolo was quoted by the ANSA news agency as saying it was believed“that the player died from a cardiac arrest, the result of natural causes”. “GOODBYE
      CAPTAIN” Fiorentina president Andrea Della Valle said Astori had been due to sign a new contract on Monday that would have kept him at the Florence-based club for the rest of his playing career. “Davide was a true captain, a great person and it
      was an honour to have him hear for these years,” he told reporters. Former Italy Prime Minister Matteo Renzi was one of the first to pay tribute to the player. “It seems impossible. I’m in a state of disbelief and I cry with his family and all of
      Fiorentina. Goodbye captain,” he said on Twitter. AC Milan coach Gennaro Gattuso said football became meaningless in such circumstances.“I can’t think of the derby after a tragedy like that,” he said on Twitter. The teams were already on the pitch
      and warming up for the lunchtime match between Genoa and Cagliari when news broke of Astori’s death. screen and left in silence when it was announced that the game would not go ahead. Italian media reported that Cagliari coach Diego Lopez, a former
      team mate of Astori, needed medical treatment on hearing the news. Veteran Juventus goalkeeper Gianluigi Buffon wrote on Instagram:“You were the best expression of an out-of-fashion, old world ruled by values such as generosity, elegance, politeness
      and respect towards other people. You’ve been one of the best sportspeople I’ve ever met.” Former AS Roma playmaker Francesco Totti said he was “shocked, incredulous and speechless for this tragedy”. Cesare Prandelli, Astori’s coach in most of his
      Italy games, said he was“deeply upset, I feel a great emptiness inside”. Giovanni Malago, the head of the Italian Olympic Committee and acting head of Serie A, said it was his duty to call off Sunday’s matches, which he did at the request of the
      clubs. “I have spoken to more than one doctor and I don’t want to get involved in speculation,” he said.“I believe that no doctor in the world can ever tell you that there is a foolproof remedy when it comes to the risk of sudden death.”
